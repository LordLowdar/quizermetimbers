## INTRO

This project was intended to show skills learned in JavaScript. It included saving local storage and interval functions.
It is a timed test that checks if the answer is correct or incorrect. Each with its own rewards and penalty.
As it were however I got sick and this will need to be redone.

## USAGE

It is a simple test without much to it
